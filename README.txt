 This is an app to find, set, and save background colors of your choice.
 You'll also have the option to pick a random color or delete a selected 
 color of your choosing.

Using the examples from class I didn't have to many issues. The parts I did have 
trouble with were more from something extra I added that wasn't part of the assignment.
The part I'm talking about is the error message used to let the user know if their 
color is already saved in list then disappear after 2 seconds. Using StackOverflow and 
GeeksForGeeks I was able to find the .postDelayed method which solved my time delay 
problem. Besides that all went ok. It was a fun project to work on.
