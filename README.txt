 This is a simple app to find, set, and save background colors of your choice.
 You'll also have the option to pick a random color or delete a selected 
 color of your choosing. There will be 3 sliders allowing you to set the 
 0-255 RGB value for red, green, and blue. Once you find the color you 
 desire you can then choose to save that color to the list of colors or 
 continue searching for that color of your dreams. There is also a random 
 color button in case you wanna roll the dice and let fate find the color 
 for you. 

Using the examples from class I didn't have to many issues. The parts I did have 
trouble with were more from something extra I added that wasn't part of the assignment.
The part I'm talking about is the error message used to let the user know if their 
color is already saved in list then disappear after 2 seconds. Using StackOverflow and 
GeeksForGeeks I was able to find .postDelayed which solved my time delay 
problem. Besides that all went well. It was a fun project to work on.
